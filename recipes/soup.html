            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This recipe will tell you to put a cauliflower and an onion in a pot, add water, then add water... then add some more water. You probably want to put down the cookbook and wander away looking fora  cheeseburger, right? It sounds downright grim, but Paul Bertoli, who was at the helm of Chez Panisse and Oliveto for more than twenty years, knows exactly how to make a vegetable become the best it can be. His formula for cauliflower soup is precise to the ounce and simple to follow, even with a raised eyebrow. (Seriously, more water?) With a little boiling and swirling in a blender, the cauliflower puts up no resistance––the vegetable's natural pectin is enough to make it creamy, without any added dairy.</p>
                <p>It's tempting to add crème fraîche or bacon, <i>vadouvan</i>, or a thick lump of butter––trust me, all of them would be delicious––but I encourage you to not add a thing. When you curb your instincts to overseason and overfatten, yes, sometimes you end up with gruel––but sometimes you get a supple, magical puree that's delicate and sweet and smooth as a flannel scarf. Even if you're not a fan of cauliflower (Bertolli isn't), make an exception for this soup.</p>
            
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1¼ cups old-fashioned oats</li>
                    <li>2 ripe bananas</li>
                    <li>½ cup plus 2 Tbsp. dairy-free milk</li>
                    <li>1½ tsp. ground cinnamon</li>
                    <li>½ tsp. ground cinammon</li>
                    <li>¼ tsp. kosher salt</li>
                    <li>½ tsp. vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>3 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                    <li>¼ cup dark chocolate chips</li>
                    <li>yogurt or dairy-free yogurt</li>
                    <li>pure maple syrup</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Grind 1 cup (100 g) oats in a food processor until finely ground but with some texture remaining (think coarse sawdust), about 1 minute.</li>
                    <li>Peel 1 banana and tear into large pieces. Add to ground oats along with dairy-free milk, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, vanilla, and 3 Tbsp. oil. Process, stopping to scrape down sides as needed, until well combined. Remove bowl from base and stir chocolate chips (if using) and remaining ¼ cup (29 g) oats into batter. Let sit 15 minutes; it should be slightly thickened.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, thinly slice remaining banana and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Heat 1 tsp. oil in a 10" or 12" nonstick skillet over medium-high, swirling to coat bottom of pan. Working in batches of 2 or 3, depending on the size of your pan and the confidence you have in flipping, scoop in about ¼ cup batter per pancake and flatten slightly with a spatula. Arrange a few reserved banana slices on top, then reduce heat to medium, and cook until set and golden brown underneath, 2–3 minutes. Flip pancakes over and cook on other side until golden brown, 1–2 minutes. Transfer to a large plate. Repeat with remaining batter, adding more oil to pan between batches as needed.</li>
                    <li>Serve pancakes topped with yogurt (if using) and maple syrup.</li>
                </ol>
