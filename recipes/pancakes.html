            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Like banana bread in pancake form, these pancakes have crisp edges and tender centers with big banana flavor, plus the wholesome chew of raw oats. They’re vegan, dairy-free, refined-sugar-free, and gluten-free (as long as you use gluten-free certified oats), and they come together in a food processor, which means minimal cleanup and no risk of overmixing. And while you don’t have to add the chocolate chips, a bit of their sweet richness goes a long way. We think singer Jack Johnson would be proud.</p>
            
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1¼ cups old-fashioned oats</li>
                    <li>2 ripe bananas</li>
                    <li>½ cup plus 2 Tbsp. dairy-free milk</li>
                    <li>1½ tsp. ground cinnamon</li>
                    <li>½ tsp. ground cinammon</li>
                    <li>¼ tsp. kosher salt</li>
                    <li>½ tsp. vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>3 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                    <li>¼ cup dark chocolate chips</li>
                    <li>yogurt or dairy-free yogurt</li>
                    <li>pure maple syrup</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Grind 1 cup (100 g) oats in a food processor until finely ground but with some texture remaining (think coarse sawdust), about 1 minute.</li>
                    <li>Peel 1 banana and tear into large pieces. Add to ground oats along with dairy-free milk, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, vanilla, and 3 Tbsp. oil. Process, stopping to scrape down sides as needed, until well combined. Remove bowl from base and stir chocolate chips (if using) and remaining ¼ cup (29 g) oats into batter. Let sit 15 minutes; it should be slightly thickened.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, thinly slice remaining banana and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Heat 1 tsp. oil in a 10" or 12" nonstick skillet over medium-high, swirling to coat bottom of pan. Working in batches of 2 or 3, depending on the size of your pan and the confidence you have in flipping, scoop in about ¼ cup batter per pancake and flatten slightly with a spatula. Arrange a few reserved banana slices on top, then reduce heat to medium, and cook until set and golden brown underneath, 2–3 minutes. Flip pancakes over and cook on other side until golden brown, 1–2 minutes. Transfer to a large plate. Repeat with remaining batter, adding more oil to pan between batches as needed.</li>
                    <li>Serve pancakes topped with yogurt (if using) and maple syrup.</li>
                </ol>
