            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Like banana bread in pancake form, these pancakes have crisp edges and tender centers with big banana flavor, plus the wholesome chew of raw oats. They’re vegan, dairy-free, refined-sugar-free, and gluten-free (as long as you use gluten-free certified oats), and they come together in a food processor, which means minimal cleanup and no risk of overmixing. And while you don’t have to add the chocolate chips, a bit of their sweet richness goes a long way. We think singer Jack Johnson would be proud.</p>
