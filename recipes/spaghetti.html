            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>In the film <i>Porco Rosso</i>, the characters eat a visually delectable plate of spaghetti. As far as animated plates of spaghetti go, this is one of the best. Marcella Hazan's famous tomato sauce is relatively simple and will satisfy anyone craving <i>Porco Rosso</i>'s spaghetti.</p>
            
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups tomatoes, in addition to their juices</li>
                    <li>5 tablespoons of butter</li>
                    <li>1 onion, peeled and cut in half</li>
                    <li>Kosher salt</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Combine the tomatoes, their juices, the butter and the onion halves in a saucepan. Add a pinch or two of salt.</li>
                    <li>Place over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Cook, uncovered, for about 45 minutes. Stir occasionally, mashing any large pieces of tomato with a spoon. Add salt as needed.</li>
                    <li>Discard the onion before tossing the sauce with pasta. This recipe makes enough sauce for a pound of pasta.</li>
