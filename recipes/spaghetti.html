            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>In her famous tomato sauce, all you do is simmer tomatoes for 45 minutes with butter and a split onion. The full, true tomato flavor is a revelation, as is finding out you don't need to cook in layers of garlic and herbs to get there (and you're better off without them).</p>
            
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups tomatoes, in addition to their juices</li>
                    <li>5 tablespoons of butter</li>
                    <li>1 onion, peeled and cut in half</li>
                    <li>Kosher salt</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Combine the tomatoes, their juices, the butter and the onion halves in a saucepan. Add a pinch or two of salt.</li>
                    <li>Place over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Cook, uncovered, for about 45 minutes. Stir occasionally, mashing any large pieces of tomato with a spoon. Add salt as needed.</li>
                    <li>Discard the onion before tossing the sauce with pasta. This recipe makes enough sauce for a pound of pasta.</li>
                </ol>
