            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>"Simple doesn't mean easy," Marcella Hazan wrote in 2004, a quote widely cited to explain her cooking style and influence. “I can describe simple cooking thus: Cooking that is stripped all the way down to those procedures and those ingredients indispensable in enunciating the sincere flavor intentions of a dish.”</p>
                <p>In her famous tomato sauce, all you do is simmer tomatoes for 45 minutes with butter and a split onion. The full, true tomato flavor is a revelation, as is finding out you don't need to cook in layers of garlic and herbs to get there (and you're better off without them).</p>
            
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 pounds fresh, ripe tomatoes, prepared as described at right, or 2 cups canned imported Italian tomatoes, cut up, with their juice</li>
                    <li>5 tablespoons butter</li>
                    <li>1 medium onion, peeled and cut in half</li>
                    <li>Salt</li>
                    <li>1 to 1½ pounds pasta, cooked, for serving</li>
                    <li>Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, for serving</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Put either the prepared fresh tomatoes or the canned in a saucepan; add the butter, onion, and salt; and cook, uncovered, at a very slow, but steady simmer for about 45 minutes, or until it is thickened to your liking and the fat floats free from the tomato. Stir from time to time, mashing up any large pieces of tomato with the back of a wooden spoon.</li>
                    <li>Taste and correct for salt. Discard the onion before tossing with pasta. Serve with freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for the table.</li>
                </ol>
