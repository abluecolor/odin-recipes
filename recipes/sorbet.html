            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>We're taught to zest our lemons carefully, to shear off just the thin yellow top coat that holds the citrusy perfume—as if some of the bitter, spongy white pith might sneak in and ruin everything. (And sometimes it does.)</p>
                <p>But Ruth Rogers and Rose Gray, founders of the famed River Café in London, realized that, taken in the right proportions, some pith would add depth but not bitterness to a sweet dessert. So they told us to pulverize a whole chopped lemon, pith and all, and make strawberry sorbet out of it.</p>
                <p>The process is enough to convinece anyone, young or old, that the kitchen is an exciting place to be. Just three ingredients make a series of quick, colorful transformations, all in one food processor bowl. You get to see not only what strawberries look like as they surrender and slacken into a hot-pink soup, but also what happens when chopped lemon and sugar become one––going from sand to slush in just a few pulses. And because this effortlessly dissolves the sugar, you get to bypass making a simple syrup, a step often considered mandatory in sorbet recipes. In other words, this is a truly no-cook sorbet.</p>
                <p>It's sweet and cold, with little pucker, and since you don't strain it, you get gleeful pops of strawberry seed and shreds of lemon rind (of course, you could always pass it through a strainer if textured sorbet isn't your thing, but for the true, rustic Rogers-and-Gray experience, don't).</p>
                <p>Serve it as an invigorating dessert after something grilled and meaty. Or ease a scoop into a glass of seltzer or ginger ale and go sit in the sunshine.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 to 3 lemons, one seeded and roughly chopped, the others juiced</li>
                    <li>2 cups sugar</li>
                    <li>2 pounds strawberries, hulled</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place the lemon pieces into a food processor with the sugar, and pulse until combined. Pour into a bowl.</li>
                    <li>Puree the strawberries in a food processor and add to the lemon mixture, along with the juice of 1 lemon. Taste and add more juice as necessary. The flavor of the lemon should be intense but should not overpower the strawberries. Pour the mixture into an ice cream machine and churn until frozen. Serve immediately or transfer to a lidded container in the freezer until serving.</li>
                </ol>
