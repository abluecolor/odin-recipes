            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>The mouthwatering smell of pollo asado brings to mind so many memories of walking from my grandparents’ house to the neighborhood fritanga stand around the corner. Fritangas are an integral part of Nicaragua’s food identity. At these food stalls, chicken, pork, or beef are marinated in naranja agria (sour orange) and barbecued to charred perfection. The protein is usually accompanied with a hefty side of gallo pinto (rice and beans), fried plantains, and a cold “glass” of soda served in a plastic bag with a straw. Naranja agria is what gives this chicken recipe its signature flavor, but equal parts fresh orange and lime juice can also do the trick.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>4 lb. whole chicken</li>
                    <li>1 bunch culantro or cilantro</li>
                    <li>1 small onion</li>
                    <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
                    <li>2 chile congos or 1 habanero chile</li>
                    <li>1 cup naranja agria juice</li>
                    <li>2 Tbsp. 1½ tsp. achiote</li>
                    <li>1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal</li>
                    <li>Vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>Lime wedges</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Spatchcock chicken by cutting along both sides of the backbone with kitchen shears or a sharp knife. Remove backbone (save for stock!) and turn chicken over on cutting board so it is resting breast side up. Press down on center of breast until you hear a crack (this will help the chicken lie flatter on the grill). Pat dry.</li>
                    <li>Purée culantro, onion, garlic, chiles, sour orange juice, achiote paste, and 1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a blender until smooth. Place chicken in a resealable bag or large bowl and pour marinade over; turn to coat. Seal bag (or cover bowl) and chill at least 4 hours and up to 1 day.</li>
                    <li>Prepare a grill for medium-high indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill); oil grate. Remove chicken from marinade, letting any excess marinade drip back into bag or container. Season chicken lightly with salt. Grill chicken, skin side up, over direct heat until lightly charred, about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Turn over and grill until skin is lightly charred, about 5 minutes. Turn skin side up and move to cooler part of grill. Cover and grill until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of thighs registers 165°, about 1 hour.</li>
                    <li>Transfer chicken to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes before carving. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over.</li>
                </ol>
