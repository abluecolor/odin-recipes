            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>The mouthwatering smell of pollo asado brings to mind so many memories of walking from my grandparents’ house to the neighborhood fritanga stand around the corner. Fritangas are an integral part of Nicaragua’s food identity. At these food stalls, chicken, pork, or beef are marinated in naranja agria (sour orange) and barbecued to charred perfection. The protein is usually accompanied with a hefty side of gallo pinto (rice and beans), fried plantains, and a cold “glass” of soda served in a plastic bag with a straw. Naranja agria is what gives this chicken recipe its signature flavor, but equal parts fresh orange and lime juice can also do the trick.</p>
